## Final usable dataset:
### **Baseballr package by Bill Petti**

The package contains play by play data for each year of the MLB season as well as Statcast data going back to 2015. Statcast data is some of our biggest interest in the dataset. Because there are so much data in the set, we have to make separate databases if we want to look at an entire year’s worth of play by play data. So, we have the entire year of 2019
stored in a SQL database connected to R. 


# Big Idea of Project:

Over time, home runs have dramatically increased. There have been different theories of reasons why, and the most recent theory is known as the “fly ball revolution”. From 2016 to present, the total home run record has been shattered each year (excluding the shortened 2020 COVID season.) The theory from many around the industry is that the access to advanced data around the league has led to many hitters adopting a principle that hitting the ball on the ground is bad, and the best way to optimize performance and value as a hitter is to hit the ball as hard as you possibly can while getting it off the ground (optimal launch angle and exit velocity). 

The premise is that even if you are hitting balls hard on the ground, they are most likely leading to outs because major league infielders aren’t going to make mistakes that often. On the other hand, hitting the ball hard in the air gives you a higher percentage of not only getting a hit, but also the most valuable form of a hit: the home run. Another caveat is that teams are also utilizing what’s called the “infield shift” more than ever to try to take away as many outs as possible based on where a batter is most likely to hit the ball. This has made many hitters even more conscious about hitting the ball in the air in order to attempt to “beat the shift”. Two of the main metrics that hitters have often attempted to enhance are launch angle and exit velocity. Launch angle is the degree of which the ball is coming off the bat, and exit velocity is the speed at which the ball is coming off the bat. Ground balls are classified as a launch angle <10, line drives 10-25, and fly balls 25-50. 

A goal of our project is to study the “fly ball revolution” and if the increase in home runs is likely correlated with this theory. 

# Main metrics that we are going to cover in this project, with definitions

Launch Angle: The vertical angle at which the ball leaves a player’s bat after being struck
Exit Velocity: The speed of the baseball as it leaves the player’s bat after being struck (in mph)
Batting Average: Hits/At bats. The percentage of times a hitter is reaching base via a hit
Weighted on base average (wOBA): Measures a player’s overall offensive contributions per plate appearance by taking the type of outcome into account
Hard-hit ball: Defined by Statcast as coming off the bat at >= 95 MPH
Spin Rate: Total numbers of revolutions a baseball has on its way to home plate after a pitcher releases it 
Expected Batting Average: A Statcast metric that measures the likelihood that a batted ball will result in a hit

Home runs over time have increased dramatically. The years that we are focused on inlcude 2015-2019. Besides the small dip in 2018 of total home runs, the increase has been substantial. We aim to look at factors that might be causing this to happen. Our first prediction is that the implementation of advanced data in baseball has led to teams being able to optimize player performance by hitting the ball harder and farther than ever. This leads us to two of the main variables that we will focus on in our project, launch angle and exit velocity.

```

This graph aims to show the relationship between launch angle and exit velocity and the chance that a batter will 
achieve a hit. The color is mapped by estimated batting average, which is a Statcast tool used to predict a batters 
chance of getting a hit based on their exit velocity and launch angle. The main takeaway that we see from this graph
is that hitting the ball hard at an optimal launch angle gives the batter the best chance at reaching base via a hit.
This can be seen in the saturated pockets of the graph with the orange color.

        panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-75, 75, 25))
woba
```

This is a very similar graph to the one above, but instead of using batting avgerage as the predictor, we are using 
weighted on base average (wOBA). wOBA is similar to batting average, but instead of assuming that all hits are created
equally, wOBA attempts to capture all offensive value by giving different weights to different types of offensive outcomes (i.e. single, double, triple, home run). This is why in this graph there is an even more saturated pocket that 
can be seen. It makes it more apparent that this pocket will represent the more valuable types of hits such as doubles,
triples and home runs. This balls in this pocket are generally hit harder and at a more optimal launch angle than some of the points on the previous graph.

```

In the first graphic, by breaking down each batted ball into their respective category it allows a better visual interpretation of the proportion of hit types and distance each produce. Further, this displays how the distribution of the launch of different types of batted balls overlap. This being because the flight path of the ball coming off of the bat is impacted by the spin direction of the pitch, thus producing different outcomes. Including all batted ball outcomes the launch angle range with the highest average distance and proportion of hits, as well as extra-base hits, is between 15° and 35°. This range allowing for greatest potential in distance as well as hit type since batted ball outcome is not directly attributable to launch angle, and thus can not be controlled for. Looking now at the 3D Scatter-plot it displays a downward converging trend in both exit velocity and hit distance as launch angle increases past 35°. Here in the graphic trace 4 represents the lower limit of the ideal launch range (15°) and trace 5 the upper (35°). Further, for launch angles less than 15° there is a significantly greater portion or low distance and velocity "single" hit type outcomes, displaying that in this range there is a much higher likelihood of this resulting outcome than within the 15° to 35° range.

```

By squaring the x and y axis variable it allow a greater display relationship that each unit increase in these variable interact with each other, and with hit distance. Along with the vertical limit lines displaying our theorized ideal launch angle range there is a horizontal limit displaying the threshold of batted balls deemed "Hard Hit" (>=95MPH launch speed). This displaying that overall this range produces the greatest combination of exit velocity and hit distance than those outside this range.

Batted balls that had launch angles within the 15° to 35° range an average distance 50 feet greater than the next highest category. Further, it possessed the greatest average launch speed as well as a significantly greater proportion of the batted balls resulting in a hit, and of those hits being extra base hits as well. Next isolating batted balls deemed to be hardly hit the ideal range had the highest total resulting in extra base hits, the highest average distance, as well as the highest proportion of balls resulting in hits. These tables displaying how the other ranges outside the ideal still result in a significant amount of hits, as well as hard hit balls but balls hit within the ideal range have the greatest potential for distance as well as becoming a hit.

## Transforming and Re-leveling variables
s_cr <- Statcast_2019 %>%
  mutate(z_r = ifelse(zone < 7, ifelse(zone < 4, "low", "middle"), "high"), la_sq = launch_angle^2, ila = ifelse(launch_angle >=15 & launch_angle <= 35, "Ideal (15-35 degrees)", ifelse(launch_angle < 15,"Below 15 degrees", "Above 35 degrees")), ila = fct_relevel(ila, levels=c("Ideal (15-35 degrees)", "Below 15 degrees", "Above 35 degrees")), bb_type = fct_relevel(bb_type, levels=c("line_drive", "ground_ball", "fly_ball", "popup")), ls_sqr = sqrt(launch_speed), warm = ifelse(effective_speed >= 90, "Gas", ifelse(effective_speed <= 75, "slow", "Norm")))

## Creating Training and Test sets
split_dummy <- sample(c(rep(0, 0.7 * nrow(s_cr)), rep(1, 0.3 * nrow(s_cr))))
data_train <- s_cr[split_dummy == 0, ]
data_test <- s_cr[split_dummy == 1, ]
``` 

The variables that were chosen to be placed within the model are: effective pitch speed, release spin rate, the interaction of effective pitch speed and release spin rate, launch speed, launch angle, the interaction of launch speed angle, batted ball type, and pitch location. In transforming the data to be applied to the model the launch angle was converted to a dummy categorical variable specifying the ideal or above/below ranges, the pitch location variable was divided into three categories of high/middle/low, and the batted ball type was re-leveled with line drive placed first.

``` {r}

my_lm <- lm(hit_distance_sc ~ release_spin_rate*effective_speed + ila + launch_speed + bb_type + launch_speed_angle + z_r, data = data_train)

# Ranking Predictors
kable(data.frame(anova(my_lm2) %>% mutate(percent_var = `Sum Sq`/sum(`Sum Sq`), mean_percent_var = `Mean Sq`/sum(`Sum Sq`))))

## Plotting the Model's Residuals
autoplot(my_lm2, which=1:3)
```

Looking at the power of the model it is significantly high with a total of ~92.5% of the variation in hit distance being explained. Further, the standard error of the model being ~38 feet is permissible since there are intangible variables that effect distance that are or can not be included in the model. It appears that in the model the predictors which positively effect distance are: launch speed, interaction of launch speed and angle,  interaction of effective pitch speed and release spin rate, pitch location middle/low, batted ball type fly ball. Further, those with negative relationships, or reduce hit distance, were effective pitch speed, release spin rate, launch angle range above 35°/below  15°, and batted ball type pop up/ground ball. This effectively displaying hitting hard (above 95MPH exit velocity) line drives or fly balls that have a launch angle of 15° to 35°, on characteristically fastballs, is the best theoretical approach to hitting according to the model. These batted balls having the highest potential for overall hit distance, which is correlated with a greater proportion hits as well as extra base hits. It does appear that for balls that are within 200 feet the model innacurately predicts them but these balls are exposed to a much higher degree of intangible effect and thus are outliers in regard to the majority of batted balls, thus not displaying true heteroscedasity in the residuals.

Plotting expected batting average, average launch angle, and home run probability in regard to pitch location in the strike zone better displays the effects of pitch location on hit distance than the model coefficients. Independently launch angle is highest for pitches up and center in the strike zone, expected batting average is highest in the lower heart of the strike zone, and home run probability is highest in the direct center of the strike zone. Thus, the lower bound of the ideal launch angle range begins in the lower heart of the strike zone. Thus, while the average of our ideal range is displayed to result from high pitches in the strike zone to a greater degree those pitches occurring in the middle and lower portions of the strike zone produce a much higher probability of the batted ball being a hit in general as well as a home run. Therefor displaying that while the ideal launch angle is seen more in the higher portion of the strike zone it are the pitches within the middle and lower portion of the zone that provide a better chance of getting a hit and greater hit distance as well.
